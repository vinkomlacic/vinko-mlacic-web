# Personal Website 🎭

Another React website in the vast sea of React websites. At least this one has a sense of humor.

## 🚀 Features

- React (because why not join the bandwagon?)
- Responsive design (it works on your phone, probably)
- Performance (faster than my last relationship)
- UI (it has buttons and stuff)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- React (the framework that's definitely not overhyped)
- TypeScript (for when you want to argue with your code)
- Vite (it builds stuff, sometimes)
- CSS (the language that makes designers cry)

## 🏗️ Project Structure

```
src/
├── components/     # Where components live their best life
├── pages/         # Pages that may or may not work
├── assets/        # Pictures and other things that make it pretty
├── styles/        # CSS that will probably break in production
└── utils/         # Code that seemed like a good idea at the time
```

## 🚦 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (or don't, I'm not your boss)
- npm/yarn (pick one, they're basically the same thing)

### Installation

1. Clone this thing:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vinko-mlacic-web.git
cd vinko-mlacic-web
```

2. Install stuff:
```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

3. Start it up:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

It'll probably be running at `http://localhost:5173` or some other port that you'll figure out.

## 🏗️ Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```

The build will be in `dist/`. Good luck with that.

P.S. If you find a bug, it's probably a feature. If you find a feature, it's probably a bug. If you find neither, you're probably not looking hard enough. 🎭
